Its become a sig spam fest and corner camping pussy ring its unbearable, The amount of passive bitch ass players who only main scythe or axe as those weapons play the game for you they're so fucking easy its a joke.

you no longer need skill for this game if you can spam like a bitch and passive loser then youll get diamond no problem real skill is no longer a thing sit in gold/plat forever dont even bother with ranked full of brain dead kids.

Dont even get me started on the broken weapon throwing that on its own is a fucking stupid mechanic and the dodge just plays into the broken weapons favour anyway, I hope the game dies its so fucking terrible its becoming a cookie clicker.

2021-10-26 5:26,"Over 1000 hours in, and this being the most played game in my Steam Library, here's a new, revised review. 

The game is fun. The learning curve is steep. But the satisfaction of winning by outplaying your opponent, or winning 1v2 in clutch game, is worth the effort of learning. 

So what is Brawlhalla? 
At face value, it probably makes you think of a budget Super Smash Bros game. And the moment you step into it, it probably feels like that too. But, this is one of those hard-to-master titles. Learn-to-love titles graphically. The true learning of the game is learning to avoid, then per weapon type, then per hero, and mastering your combination of personal favourite weapon on a hero with their own signature attacks.  

Why should you play it? 
Well, my personal anwer would be: It is a great game to play to between other games, when you have little time, or to use a break from other activities. Does that mean you can't play it as a main game? Well no, but a normal 3-stock game vs 1 or 2 players usually takes a couple of minutes. Every game. If you play this for an hour, you've done quite a few matches in that time. The whole reason I have a 1000+ hours in, is because of how much I use it as a game to break or unwind from something else. In time, that really ramps up fast. 

Why should you not play it? 
One reason. It can really get under your skin. Sometimes it just doesn't work in your favor. You attacks miss, you dodge, and every teammate leaves early or isn't as skilled the other players in the match leaving you to 1v2 matches in a row. That's just how it is. There's a flow, and you gotta learn to ride it to do well. This is not a game for people who get sore from losing games easily. 

Personal recommendations? 
This is just my opinion. Lets talk gamemodes. Free For All is a poor presentation of the game. I consider this the 'Whoever spams signature attacks most succesfully to steal kills, wins. It is the kids-mode. Non-ranked 1v1 modes; These are great for learning and testing yourself. The ranked 1v1 is the best way of validating your skill. The one with a different hero per stock life is great for learning to adapt to opponents, which is a key thing to learn and get better at the game. And the event gamemodes are just fun, although often filled with the same spamming kids from Free For All, sadly. Lately there's been ranked versions of these modes as well, and that's a great addition imo! Now 2v2, both ranked and non-ranked are my favourite gamemodes. You need a friend to play ranked, and it is more punishing as friendly fire is possible in ranked, where it is not in non-ranked (unless bombs hit a teammate). 

Additional customisation ingame is available through either leveling characters: You unlock colors, can earn competitive point for unlocking specific weapon skins (cross-character), and can play around with unlocking stances that slightly changes your character's stats. I've owned the purchasable pack that unlocks every character for me since the start, but if you start playing the free mode, the heroes available rotate each week. I do recommend putting some hours in before you consider buying a pack like that though. Furthermore there's a battlepass and non-pay-to-win cosmetic shop that unlocks cool skins, knockout effects, minions, avatars and crossover skins from known brands (Rayman, Ninja-Turtles, ect.)",TRUE

2021-07-03 15:21,"The only positive this game has is rollback netcode.  Its the only official, retail platform fighter so far to have rollback.  Coupled with being F2P and crossplay, the only way I can recommend this is if you want to play a platform fighter with no financial commitment required with your friends.

Besides that one positive...
-The most boring character designs, sharing the same animation rig to make selling skins/emotes, etc super easy. Copy/paste of movesets through the weapon system, with the concept of ""special moves"" you would expect from a platform fighter replaced with ""signature moves"", aka smash attacks that are the only unique thing to a character.  Also makes it hard to notice your own character flying away when trading attacks in FFA, since everyone is animated the exact same.  There is also no unique audio for characters.
-Floaty, think Smash Bros Brawl but with laggy momentum.  However there is air dashing so its not that terrible overall.
-So many attacks have a lot of end lag on whiff, but a much safer automatic follow up on hit.  There are no landing animations for air attacks, which looks bad and feels sluggish.  Combo’s are not satisfying to land, especially online with higher ping(rollbacks).
-Few/hard to notice effects, and no hit stop on attacks.  It makes the rollbacks super infuriating, its hard to see when/how attacks interact with higher pings.  Invulnerability while dodging causes hardly any visual light effect, and produces no distinguishing sound.  This point is honestly my biggest complaint, the visual and audio feedback in Brawlhalla is practically nonexistent.
-Is there no ping meter?  Tf?  It would make the rollbacks a bit more bearable if I knew exactly how bad the lag was.
-The UI is trash.  From the main menu to the in-game damage icons, everything is inconveniently placed.

Im dropping this as soon as RoA implements rollback.  I never play this offline.",FALSE

2021-01-23 0:06,"If you're looking for a Super Smash-sort of game but not exactly that, this is one of my favourite games hands down. I've been playing Brawlhalla on my Switch for the last 2 years with 1,000+ hours logged and have been addicted to this rage-inducing game. 

What I love:
- Great platform fighter with smooth controls and lots of different weapons that can match your playstyle
- I've never loved Smash as I find that with such a large character selection, the playing field is not level at all. Every character has different 'light attack' moves, signatures, etc. and you have to re-learn each character. With Brawlhalla, I love that I can pick up any legend and the base weapon moves are the same (i.e. an axe/scythe legend and an axe/lance legend; the axe light attack moves are the exact same.) The signatures and the stats would be different which gives each legend a unique playstyle, but also if you're tired of that character but love the axe weapon, you can easily pick another axe legend and know at least half the basics/combos.
- Unique characters, originality, and lore that I've never seen before in other games
- Art style of the game is timeless and attractive; being a F2P game, I've spent money on microtransactions as I love the game that much, the battle passes are very worth it, and the skins are affordable and great looking- that being said, you do NOT need to spend money on the game to win. These purchases are purely cosmetic changes.
- AMAZING dev team; I've never watched any Twitch streams before Brawlhalla but the Devs are extremely likeable, transparent, and put out interesting content. They take care of their community. Lots of tournaments and e-sports as well.
- Different modes of play; 1v1, 2v2, multiplayer, experimental, etc. The multiplayer games are super easy to create or join in, and really fun to play like Bubble Tag, Capture the Flag, and Brawlball (2-8 players). The game modes are innovative and friends can easily download the game and join you (but learning curve is hard, point is below).

What I Don't Love:
- Absolutely rage inducing. Many times I've come close to smashing the controller into the TV. If you get railed by a diamond/plat player properly, you'd give respects to how well they played, but if it's a new player/troll/terrible player that is spamming signatures and giving you that salt shaking taunt, it's infuriating and obviously there are toxic players which further ruins your experience.
- For new players, it's a very steep learning curve and unfortunately if you lose interest and don't really get into the game, and don't know how to dodge and combo properly, you won't make it very far and will probably give up this great game. It has taken me and my 2v2 partner 2 years to reach platinum (casual players). We were terrible in the beginning and we did not get any better until we started watching YouTube videos and playing more to learn the characters, dodges, and combos. We are still not great tbh.
- Balancing of the weapons is iffy sometimes. For example, they released the Great Sword weapon last Fall and it has dominated the tournaments and general gameplay. It was very obvious that there needed to be further testing and tweaking before releasing, especially right before the World Championships, but this wasn't done. They only just nerfed it last week and it's been better. 

All in all, I've stuck by this game almost every day for 2 years. It's so solid and easy to pick up and play for a few games or play for hours. The Dev team is constantly putting out free content, having 2-3 streams on Twitch a week, and updating the game. It's a fun game that my partner and I can play and enjoy together, and the highs of winning are exhilarating, but with the highs comes the infuriating lows. You'll see some reviews saying how it's terrible and toxic, but that just means that they need a break from the game and should come back to it later. My only suggestion for those who've never played Brawhalla before is to try to stick with it to get past that learning curve and try to find a partner to play with. Makes it much more enjoyable.

2020-07-01 5:50,"EDIT 1.7.2020  THIS GAME IS CANCER - ALL U NEED TO KNOW oh and 2 trillion skins for 6 € each or even more expensive ... cool ... ye fuck that

u reached gold 3 ? congrats from now on play against diamond or high platin 
 f this shit

EDIT : forget this game its not fun anymore to play becuz everyone  is just passive  and wait till the oponent attacked first cuz that nearly always win the devs kept changing the cds into shit  that this  in comb with the dash ( what already destroyed for a lot of guys the game as it joined in) is possible and instead of changing at least completly retarded Hitboxes all they do is patching more paywall - locked Skins They rly turned the game over the years into a rly annoyin experience for me and right now i think about leaving forever this game




U like Super smash?  Then u can insta download it is it f2p no p2w cuz everything u can buy is just cosmetic ( but completly retarded expensive  if u think what u get for that amount so i dont recommend to grab that but ofc its ur own decision)
In my opinion preaty nice game  every champ ( i gues right now few less than 30 and the developers focus in 2017 to realse every Month one champ cuz it was wanted from the community ) has teh combination out of 2 weapons which u cant change ( sounds bad but its good if u play a while cuz then bob champs like hatori and fist shithads * mad mad cry cry mad mad* has even more shit finishers to spam around u without any skill or logical hitboxes but whatever i salt around again
Anyway each weapons playstyle is completly different to annother and each weapon has light/fast attacks which are for all champs the same and different heavy/slow attacks which are on EVERY char different

Few Tipps to get started & Improve:

- DONT play Fist/sword chars at the start cuz then u get the feeling for spam and not the game Mechanics/Timing for     Dodge etc.

- DONT spam Dodge just cuz the cd on it is gone Try to use it only if its necessary then u Improve faster

- If u wanna learn most fasted way how to play go and try 1vs1 game mode other modes are like Aram in lol they are  there and they are bullshit for  the worst of casuals

- Light/fast Attacks for Fighting Heavy for finishing

- Hold some distance between u and the Opponent and try to get a feeling for what the enemie will do in which Situation


However in interested in what will happen in the Future and i hope they gonna introduce a Reaper Themed/Death themed char cuz they introduced with the last new Char the new Scythe weapon which is preaty nice after all this Shitty-Fists-of-Spam-made-for-Shitty-Casuals-who-even-dont-know-the-Buttons-on - a - Controller-and-use-the-Head-instead-of-fingers-to-controll *SALT SALT SALT*

Not to mention on your pov someone is faced the other way and hits you with directional attacks facing the other way because it doesnt even register them turning around. Honestly sick of sticking at 1600 league due to doing well and then dropping 100 elo because of games like this one after another. Its pathetic.

EDIT, May 27 2017. 
Game is still honestly the exact same way. Have stopped playing at this point because ive realized this will not change ever. Im at 316 hours now , and this number will not go up

EDIT, June 25 2020.
Somehow the devs have never learned how to balance, now random moves hit through dodges but sometimes also choose to just not do it,

Ranked matches don't show ELO, but constantly was matched with people in Platinum or Diamond despite being at 1600 ELO ( gold )

The game is still kinda fun, but pretty frustrating at times. The ranked play is VERY unbalanced. My buddy and I, who were both platinum in solo, would duo ranked and be placed against people who were top 100. Really takes a lot of the fun out of it.

The game also feels like more of a cash grab now. There are too many characters to take as long as it does to unlock new ones without buying them with real money.

-fun mechanics with good hitboxes

cons
-toxic community (says stuff like ez, youre trash, and just very unsupportive)
-Ranked matchmaking can be very weird in who it places where (im in gold and sometimes face platinum and diamond players)note: could be my location
-balancing issues with certain characters
-Gameplay focused on punishing rather than taking the initiative, this means that passive play is super strong and it can be frustrating at times.

But seriously:) This game looks promising and it might be just the right thing for you, if you like quick, fast and massive action with other players, friends, rivals or even bots with funny names. The game is still in early access, but if it keeps on growing, which I sincerely hope, then it could become a great finished game to spend lots of time in.

Edit: to honor this game as my Recommendation for the Steam Awards with huge massive destructive potential (the ""Cry Havoc And Let Slip The Dogs Of War"" Award ... so fitting every time I start the game) 
I guess it has been quite some time since I wrote my first Review - since then time has past, legends were knocked off platforms, weapons were suitably smashed into players faces, I have gathered hundreds of hours, devs have been amazing in forming this game to a wonderful party brawler. The small and incredibly funny player base really does not do the game justice and its constant updating with new maps, legends to play, weapons to use, game modes to experiment.

I can surely say that my prediction was right back then. I spent much more time in this ever since and the game just kept growing in all manners. This leaves me with a ""I still and even more recommend this game to anyone now""... Just make sure to have tissues ready for the OMG SERIOUSLY?! moments (still killing myself with bombs randomly) :D",TRUE

2017-11-22 22:32,"Before I begin let's talk about the cash shop. They have one, it only sells cosmetic character skins and weapon skins, You buy the characters with earned in-game gold, not money. Don't avoid because of its f2p.

Very easy to pick up with an active community and skilled players. Four modes of online play, ranked 1v1,2v2, 4 player free for all and custom lobby's that let you set the match to all sorts of things ((up to 8 players in one map)).

In the ranked matches, expect spammers in low tier with skilled players being in low gold and up. Spam happens, but you will eventually be able to read the attack patterns and punish them easily.

 Single player is lackluster at best, but the training mode lets you try out all the legends((and check out the skins)) before you buy them with game earned gold.

Why do I like this game? Because I lose to players who are better than me. I do not lose to spam or ""cheap"" characters because the game does not reward these things. It is up to the player to learn how to play the game. At the start, you might win some matches by spamming. More power to you, if your opponent does not know how to counter your spam you will always win. Once they do, however, you can either keep mashing the keys hoping it works, or you can improve.

This is a game of skill, pure and simple. Luck does not play a part of it, and I can honestly say after 100+ hours, there is not one single character better than the other. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but the game allows you to the main one and win if you are better than the player on the other side. In the immortal words of our forums, ""git gud"".

Steam this is your fault as much as the devs of this game. You allow devs to change such fundamental things after launch - after cashing in. Slimy bastards.

There's people who like to smurf: ""At higher skill levels, create a new account just to beat lower levels.""

Game lags - in a fighting game where the goal is to kick people off the center platform... well every micro-second counts. Game-breaking lag.

Match-making is horrid. Sometimes you get matched up with people 200 rating under you, other times 200 above you. Unbalanced.

Every ""season"" resets everyone's progress. Effectively making the entire player base stronger. It's good and bad. I don't like losing my progress personally and I think averaging the ELO between every season would be more representative of my skills.

I rate this game:
3/10",FALSE
2017-07-07 23:02,"Do you like Super Smash Bros.?  Do you want a verison of Smash on PC?  If you answered ""yes"" to both of these questions, there's a very high probability that this game is for you.

It's just as you would expect- do damage to your opponents and hit them hard enough to send them flying off the stage.

Brawlhalla takes a unique approach to making its characters different from each other; all fighters have the exact same basic moveset, but each uses a different combination of weapons, including firearms, swords, spears, axes, scythes, and more (for example, Cross, a mobster, can use guns and gauntlets, the bandit Lucien uses guns and katars, the samurai Koji uses swords and bows, etc.) that they can pick up during a battle.  When equipped, their moves change to use the weapon they're holding- a regular attack that hits upward may now hit to the side using the same input, for example, so it's best to quickly learn what changes when you grab a weapon.  Other items, such as mines and spiked balls, appear, and you can throw these at opponents.

While it may seem that the pool of heroes is just thrown together randomly, each fighter is given a distinct background explaining who they are, what they've done to become legendary, and what, if any, motives they have for participating in battles.  It's a nice touch to the fighters and makes them feel like they have presence; they're not cardboard.

Functionally, the game is identical to Smash Bros., but there are noticeable differences to the gameplay.  For example, in Smash, you can hang off of ledges; this is not possible in Brawlhalla.  Instead, fighters will grip the walls and slowly slide down unless they jump off or attack, essentially dictating that players ""climb"" up.  While there's no percentage meter to show exactly how much damage a player has taken, a half circle suurounds a character's icon, starting at white but going to yellow to orange to red; the deeper the shade of red, the easier it will be to KO that player.  There isn't actually any way to shield or block attacks- the only defensive/evasive measure a player can use is a dash that renders them invulnerable for a very brief moment.  This dash can also be used to gain air, so it can be used to get back to the stage as well.  It cannot be spammed, so it must be executed wisely.

Now let's talk about the Free-to-Play aspect.  The game is free to play, but without paying, you only get access to 6 of the now 30 fighters, with the 6 you can pick from changing every few days.  It's recommended you get the All Legends pack, which grants access to all fighters at any time, including any more that are added later.  That isn't a problem.  What IS an issue, however, is everything else.  With the All Legends pack, you have the meat of the game- the fighters- right there.  Anything extra, such as new skins, taunts, and even icons have to be bought using in-game currency, called Mammoth Coins.  The thing about that is that they cannot be earned through in-game means, you have to buy them.  I understand this is how the developers make their money from this game, but the prices for most extras cost large and perhaps ridiculous amounts of MCs.  For example, the minimum amount you can put towards MCs is $5.99, for 140 MCs.  Most extras cost around 100 MCs.  So you're basically paying 5$ for one taunt.  For one new skin.  For one PLAYER ICON.  There's even one KO animation that costs roughly $10.  Like I said, I know these are how the devs really make the revenue from this game, but those prices are just completely unreasonable.  I would stay away from those unless you REALLY play a specific character a lot and/or have money to burn.

So, to recap:

PROS-
-Gameplay like Smash Bros
-Interesting characters
-Fighters use different combos of weapons to define their playstyles
-Fluid animation and framerate
-Solid online play
-Numerous game modes in addition to classic Sma- er, I mean, Brawlhalla
-up to 8 players (good luck pulling that off though)

CONS-
-Some weapons feel imbalanced, such as Scythes, which are new
-Things like taunts, skins, KO animations, rescue parties, and even icons cost unreasonable prices of real money
-Tactics such as camping and edgeguarding are much easier to pull off than in Smash
-Music is only kind of ""eh""
-The community can get quite toxic- insults like ""trash"" and ""f**got"" and ""n***er"" get thrown around a lot, especially in ranked battles no matter if the offender won or lost

Luckily, the game is F2P, so you can always try it first before you sink any money into it, reasonable amounts or otherwise.  But I will tell you that Brawlhalla is worth getting at least the All Legends pack for.",TRUE

  Spam. OMG. This is the worst thing about this game, Literally all someone has to do to usually win is the same thing over and over again. From inescapable moves to the zero to death combos people are able to pull. It's just not cool, and i wish the game had more ways to counter.

  Community: It's trash. Completely and utteraly trash. Yeah sure, you'll meet some nice people here or there, but if your spamming because your so tired of losing all the time, the round will end with kys, f off, hang yourself. or, even if they barely win its nothing but ""GG ez"" which, i know sounds petty for someone to complain about, but you don't undestand until you ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME.

  lag issues are a thing also, which can completely ruin game experience. this game requires you to be able to dodge or counter at the right moment, so when you lag you can't  really do much. It's not that im  playing on a crap system, or that my internet is bad, because it's really not that hard to meet any of those standards. it's just game servers bugging out sometimes.

  Down to my final point. I tried to take this game competitively, and no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i play, i can't get anywhere.

Well I should probably elaborate and bring in more points and statements and something about my own personal experience here shouldnt I? Well -ahem- Lets begin at what is plainly known as the Beginning since its prudent to start there and everyone has probably skipped this part to the next paragraph beneath here so enough of the prattle and on with the rattle

I freaking love this game to a T and do score 10/10 (no I wasn't paid to say that but even if I was it wouldnt make a difference) because of fun interactions with other players in game but running into some of the devs IRL and speaking to them a bit about this game is a reinforcer for me to become even more endeared to this game. Being a fan of free for all brawls game much like nintendo's Smash game I find the same charm within this game.

Each character has their own unique weapons in game that can be picked up as they spawn as glowing excaliburs in the ground, depending on your charcter you will arm yourself with one of two of their unique weapons as you Heft the glowing excalibur from where it may fall, extra items such as bombs, spike balls, and even horns to call upon your hovering ally to bring you a glowing excalibur to wield what it may be against your enemies

with a fun pre game lobby to occupy you while you wait for a match to come up (for me I've had pretty good luck with match made games and havent had a connection issues at all) when it comes down to it the action begins in a fast paced furious fight for 3 minutes. The more you knock your opponents off screen the more points you gain. But be careful. If you hold the lead for to long and take a lot of damage (and lets be honest you cant simply get into a scrape without catching scrapes and bruises yourself) any opponent that Knocks you out will receive double the points for taking down the lead figure (The same goes for you if you are lagging behind and need to catch up in a good way.) once the brawl is done the winners are taken to the after action screen to view their accolades and how they performed in game.

online multiplayer isn't enough and you wanna play with your friends? well if you are lucky as I am and have a damn good gaming laptop (and some extra controllers ((sub note: Yes this game offers controller support))) you and your friends can have a badass local couch party throwdown or even hop online with one of your buddies and take on the online community (it's a lot of fun by the way and i recommend it if you are a lucky man such as myself) and tag team it up

Please make somethings about this, case brawhalla used to be about skill and luck, now all u need to do is learn a combo and reapeat it for 9999999 times. Yeah, that`s how it works. In these days i can`t see a spammer. They all learn combo`s and do it all times. Please, make brawhalla great again!",FALSE

-Lack of personality in characters
-Lack of diversity in playstyles between characters
-There's only 3 items, and two of them are almost the same.

2017-03-14 13:16,"Brawlhalla is a platforming brawler fighting game explosion that blew my mind when I first played it. It was extremely entertaining and colorful, pulling me in like a magnet. The amount of characters offer a play style for everybody, and the additional content offered in the store makes the potential of setting goals for yourself, wanting to pimp out your characters to appear more professional online. speaking of online, this is probably the best challenge in the game, pitting yourself against other players to see if you're ready to go against the best. The graphics are colorful and fun, making you get the sense that the next game WILL be fun and WILL be a new and interesting challenge. The game has made a name for itself competitively, getting oppurtunities on Twitch and online tournaments. There's not much else to say. Brawlhalla is one of the best free games that the Steam store has to offer. I fully reccomend it for all people.

2017-03-10 14:13,"I've currently put 52 hours into this game and sadly I cannot recommend it in its current state. For a dumb party game with friends? Yes it's fine. For a competitive 1 v 1 game? Not quite there yet. To master this game you need to know 3 things.

1.
Each character can equip 2 weapons; you can't customize which weapons you want, they're pre set. Currently the game heavily favors Swords, Katars, and to a lesser extent Guns. So choose a character who can use at least one of these things and you already have a good upper hand.
2.
Hit boxes don't work the way you think. There is no collision detection in the game so just because you see your weapon hit your opponent it does not mean it actually hit. If you go into training mode you can turn on hit detection and bear witness to the most bizarre hit boxes ever conceived.
3.
Load up YouTube and look up combo videos. Each weapon has two or three combos and that's about it. You want to get those off as often as possible and pray the RNG gods favor you for an early kill. I have seen full charged heavy attacks not kill dark red status opponents. I have seen sword combos that get you from white to dark yellow with no escape. It's very frustrating to experience.

Also, there is strangely no indicator of when you can dodge. There's a cooldown for it after being used but the time until you can use it again has no display. That's pretty frustrating too.. All in all, fun party game (ala Diet Smash) but currently a poor competitive one.",FALSE
2017-02-28 16:00,Very good,TRUE
2017-02-28 16:00,"I do not mind this game. It is about as close to Supersmash Bros as you can get. I have played about 40 hours and I, no doubt, have enjoyed it. However, it is undeniably flawed. 

For starters, all the characters overall have the same stats, except for the newer characters who are overpowered. I have a friend who is at level 58 with one of his characters, but the one thing I noticed is that he pretty much bought everything in the game. I'm not saying it's a pay to win, but I'm not saying it's exactly broke-player-friendly. It says it is free, though I wouldn't exactly call it that.
 
Now, I recommend this game. It is fun, a good source of experience, and a splash of the fighting game that we've been waiting for. However, if you are looking for something to replace Supersmash Bros, go looks somewhere else. It'll take you forever to get the level you need to be to join the major leagues, and consider if it was all worth it.",TRUE

Pros: 
-Tons of legends to pick from 
-Definitely a varity of maps to choose from on custom lobbys
-Amazing animations

And the only Con I'd have to say is the comminuty. Doesn't really matter tho, since you can easily ignore it.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

2017-02-23 22:06,"Just got this game thinking it was just like Super Smash Bros. I can't say it isn't because it is in many ways but it also takes on it's own form. The game is a total redesign of SSB and they couldn't have done it any better. The battle is very similar providing a feel much like SSB but you have to pick up weapons just to perform your main attacks which wasn't in the last SSB I played. The attacks are very good and the maps are layed out to help use the attacks to the full potential. Some features feel somewhat useless like the block and some like the health bar seem out of place and poorly designed. Although I haven't tried competitive for fear of total annihalation  it seems great. I do have to gripe that training is not great because the other character does nothing, I wish they would move about to allow different moves. The legends are great and I could see myself buying them all in the future. I have nothing else to say but will update this review when I get more hours under my belt.",TRUE

Free to play:Its all free to play the only thing you can actually pay for is cosmetic things and thats amazing[ITS NOT P2W :D}
Multiplayer:47% of the community it a bunch of salty mutha******* and will make up any excuse to why they lost at the end of a match like theses Excuses:Unbalanced game!,imanginary lag!,Spammer!,Hattori !Ive seen them all because Ive said them all!
[
Fighting:This game is like smash bros for toddlers-It can be fun and frustrating leaving you in tears or with a gold star on your man boobs.
[
{Balance}This game is really well balanced but no one really knows because its hard to tell,The community comes together after every patch to talk about what they dont like and what needs to be changed so in the end its all a simple fix.
[
(The Combat)Jumping around *****slapping hattoris is fun and when your not having fun with ranked there are custom modes to play with 7 other frens or random people.
[
(Progression)Its a fighting game and like alll fighting games you get better over time not in a day!
[
(Weapons)Each character in brawlhalla gets 2 weapons that are possible from weapon drops and they are all pretty wacky and fun to use and do not limit you on who you play.
[
(In game communication) there is none in the match unless you have a mic talking to frens but its not a bad thing! because in game communication its pretty useless because your concentrating the whole time on smashing hattoris face in!But they have about 20 diffrent taunts and adding you can throw around to troll if you really wanted to.
(End game lobby)Where you make new frens or scream SPAMMER!

Only negative I see: Toxic community. Worse than the LoL community at times. 
Sometimes there is clear lag that puts you in mixed positions on screen -- really throwing off your strategy.

The game, often deemed a ""Smash clone,"" is quite different when it comes to mechanics, in a positive way.
There are basic attacks, special attacks, a dodge, and a weapon throw -- weapon's are a must in the game, which is a plus for variety.

Personally, I play this on my free time, and often use the 2v2 ranked game mode. There are various different game modes available as well, some that are really fun to play (Brawlball/Football, Snowbrawll/Snowball) that you can access through custom games, or seasonal events.

It invites that signature fighting style which focuses more on the environment and forcing opponents out of it.

Each character has 2 sets of moves which enforce their own fighting style; for example, Taurus, a Minotaur character, has both a hammer and an axe. Each has its own abilities.

Conversely, I get matched up with people 100 to 200 elo below me and end up pooping on them, thus continuing the vicious cycle of tilt.

I cannot stand this standard of online games. Either dedicate yourself completely or don't even bother. There has to be a middle ground. Why is it that people are not allowed to have fun when they play games. Why does it have to be a job?

I play games to express myself in a fictional space, but you get into a game like this and you have to deal with social strata where you aren't allowed to get any enjoyment unless you are in the upper crust, and to get to the upper crust you have to pour blood sweat and tears. Don't get be wrong I am all for progression, I am all for skill. But I am sick and tired of paying for a game and then when I go to play it it slams it's ass in my face and says""no you don't deserve to have fun, you're not good enough"".

Get gud they'll say. I was good, I used to have fun. I'm a damn founder, I baught this when it was in early access. Then I got bored and moved away from the game for a little while.

Is just how it is. I come into a match i get out as soon as possible cos of the salt thats is how it work.

Here are the types of players u will probably meet.
A) Either u are a pro because u play or lot or u are naturally talented wit at this sort of genre of games. Doing mad combos (diamond-plat players)
B) You rage at this game till u spill your coffee all over your brand new laptop (um..me).
C) You will meet 10 year olds that talk shit about you even they lost too you (the most common one is ""git gud u spammer"" . I don't even spam the heavy attacks bruh !)
D) You will meet people that ask you for advice for your top tier play (hardly happens too me cos i suck balls) (not lliterally if u think so then u can go fuck a tree).
E) Relax players that like this soft of stuff and doesn't ever rage (2 vs 2 e.g your helpful team mate).
F) The defensive players that wait for your attacks and then counter attacks u (fuckkkking annnoying).
G) players that run away and never fight (not the same as F cos they never attack you and no they are not bots).
H) The aggressive players that bum rush u with fury of attacks non stop.
I) AND FINALLY SPAMMERS (not that they are hard to deal with but they are a pain in the ass).

If imiss anything which i probably have say so.

If u are willing to play this game yes go for  wep with a high learning curve if u really want to be gud. e.g sword.

2017-02-14 17:59,"Excellent game, reminds me of Super Smash Bros. I would play this game anyday and not get bored of it because it literally grabs you and makes you feel involved in the gameplay. Though, I would like a better variedy of maps and such, this is still a great game to play amongst your friends.

Pros:
+ Use the mouse and WASD or just the keyboard.
+ Interesting Combos and Insta-Kill Methods.
+ Variety of clothing styles and colors in singleplayer mode.
+ Gameplay is great, it grabs you and 'makes you involved.'

Cons:
- Sometimes you lose track of where your character is.
- Few maps to choose from.
- Few characters to choose from other than what the game gives you unless you buy it with in-game currency.
- Currency takes awhile to get and can be a grind.
- Shittalkers. Everywhere.

OVERALL:
I believe that this game is overall a great game to play with a game, but becareful on other online matches because they can contain assholes and such (who shit-talk). Other than that, the game is great. It just needs more maps and needs to allow players to enjoy the game without feeling the urge or need to spend money.",TRUE

Controls are relatively easy, customization is interesting, and unlockables are just hard enough to obtain to be interesting. 

Have played very little competively and the community is salty/toxic. And like most fighting games spamming and broken characters do run rampent at times. 

HOWEVER

The game is fun to play and a great time waster. I would definitely recommend if you want a game you and your friends can play together or something along those lines. 
As for competitive or strictly matchmaking, it would really depend on your own preference. The occasional salt doesnt bother me after playing hours of CoD and Halo Wars years back, but if it gets to you, maybe look somewhere else.",TRUE

[b] Here is why i do [/b]
[list]
 [*]Weekly balancing, which is usually [i]enhancing[/i] moves/legends rather than nerfing
 [*]No P2W content period
 [*]Variety of play styles
 [*]Smash without the corky mechanics
 [*]Alternate game modes
 [*]Fair comestmetic prices
 [*]Competitive and causal play
[/list]

[strike] This game is unbalanced! [/strike]

This game is in early acess for another year at least, and gets balancing weekly.


[strike] Some legends are way OP still! [/strike]

If you are bad against a certian legend learn the dos and don'ts when fighting them.


[strike] This game is too hard! i can't rank up! [/strike]

You have two options.
[olist]
 [*]learn the meta of a legend
 [*]play casual
[/olist]
It's ranked for a reason...


[strike] The player base is too toxic stay away! [/strike]

This is slightly more valid than other points, but i still disagree. Personally i have a set of responses to tilt people who are toxic towards me. To help the problem when i play a match against someone i'll either compliment them on something they did well or give them advice to do better. The more people that will do this the better the community will be.

First time I opened the game, I litterally don't know what to do. No tutorials, nothing. Because I'm new to the game, I just went straght to single player, and click the training mode :v

Few minutes to get used to the controls, I went to multiplayer, or casual matchmaking, and choose FFA or free-for-all 4 player mode. Then you choose a hero a.k.a legend. Only 6 are unlocked tho ;-;(btw in training mode, all legends, weapon skins, colors are unlocked)(dat viking Swedish guy w/ a sledgehammer is my fav). Then you wait at a temporary match, to do warmups and stuff. Once all players are connected, you're given 4 minutes to knock players off the map or arena using  variety of weapons, from legend's weapons, to a throwable bomb. Attack combinations are possible, like jumpx2 --> down+heavy att, or just spam the f*** out :v. You start with bare hands, but eventually weapons will start spawning. You need to remember your legend look like because there's no pointer or gamertag above your legend so you need to keep track an eye on them. Winners are (of course) player with most knockouts. Once you win, you level up the legend you're playing, so you can't level up multiple legends.

Overall the game is excellent. Need a while to get used with the controls. Multiplayer is not laggy (for me), and, it's fun knock people with a charged heavy attacks. They're like, ""Oh shet"" and I'm like, ""Surprise mothaf***a!"", but please add a ponter above the legend so I know where is my legend.

Oh btw the (default) controls are:
Z --> Dash
X --> Heavy att
C --> Light att/Pickup weapons
V --> Throw ur weapon
Arrows --> Movement

I had played a decent amount of Brawlhalla on another account (around 3-4 hours time) so I did get into it for a while. The matchmaking is fairly easy to use, controls are simple to memorize and combo attacks, and the graphic style is neat, although it seems that Brawlhalla just has that certain something missing to it, what it is I cannot particularly describe, but there was a certain allure to Nintendo's SSB Series. Brawlhalla did a good job at trying to revive it, but it just didn't do the trick for me particularly. However, if you grabs some friends it is fun to play and make a little competition out of.

Enough to draw negative comments for a great game that gets alot of attention from its devs.  Losing to spam isn't brawlhalla's fault.  As far as imbalance goes, the devs patch very frequently.  They are constantly tweaking the minutiae to keep the game balanced.  They have introduced new toons, but they are patient to make changes.  I've played for a long time and not seen them nerf a character out of rash feedback.  

Each toon has the same unarmed moveset and two weapons.  For those weapons they share the same light attack moveset and some of the heavy attacks as any other toon with that weapon.  They are unique only in the remainder of their heavy attacks.  Its this commonality between toons that makes trying a new one comfortable but fun.  Gold is very easily unlocked and you can quickly get enough to unlock a new toon when it is introduced.  So there is no p2w bonus if the new toons were overpowered -which they aren't.

Each character has 2 weapons and an assortment of skills based on their weapon. Do note that the weapons have to be picked up in the match, BUT these weapons are plentiful. Although some skills seem to be static (IE if you have a spear and you up heavy attack in the air you'll always do a little helicopter spin and jump up more, if you're unarmed you all use the same basic and heavy attack.) none of the characters I played were boring and I would say at least 4/5 of them had skills that made me go ""oooo coool!!""

Characters (or ""Legends"") are very unbalanced and this game is basically pay-to-win. This is basically what you'd expect to get from a game that's free to play.

I give games a chance before criticizing them, and this game I've given way to many chances. Brawlhalla is like every other fighting platformer, there's nothing that special about it. The only thing that's special is that it's free. This game takes no skill to play, and the noobiest player could win just by spamming a few buttons with an over powered character. 

This game is fun for the first few times that you play it, but after a while you start to notice how bland it is and how it takes zero skill to win a match. It's also more fun with friends, but still not worth the trouble.

2017-01-28 9:36,"Mi stavo annoiando quindi ho detto: ""Perchè non andiamo a vedere quali perle videoludiche può offrirmi Steam""
Girando casualmente nella lista dei free to play (mi faccio ancora schifo) scorgo in fondo un titolo: ""BRAWLHALLA"". Il banner mi intrigava, le recensioni erano positive e mi ricordava Super Smash Bros. (e Dio solo sa quanto mi piaccia Super Smash Bros.), quindi l'ho scaricato e dopo averci speso più 50 ore, e aver aperto il culo a tutta la mia lista amici, posso finalmente dire che BRAWLHALLA

*Rullo di Tamburi*

E' un po' un mezzo aborto

Non è una ciofeca totale, diciamo la verità, la grafica è colorata e simpatica e, tutto sommato, diverte.
Quella che mi fanno arrabbiare sono tante piccole cose che rendono il gameplay squilibrato e irritante.

Partiamo dal primo punto: ""LE ARMI""
--------------------------------------

Ogni personaggio ha 2 armi che può raccogliere durante il match una melee, che può essere una spada, una lancia e una
scopa gigante mettallica che, come mi piace chimarla: ""LA NIMBUS 3000"", quest'ultima a volte fastidioso in quanto può prendere tutto il campo con una sola mossa impedendo così che l'avversario possa ritornare in campo e, se contiamo anche il danno sproporzionato, impedendone anche la vittoria.

Ma per lo meno è molto lenta e gli altri attacchi non sono così potenti.

L'arma di cui mi lamento sono quei fottutissimi pugni!

Non i pugni iniziali che hai senza prendere armi che sono del tutto inutili (io li uso contro gli avversari che hanno pochissima vita, solo per dimostrargli che anche senza armi sono meglio di loro) parlo dei guantoni della Cosa (io e i nomi siamo una cosa sola, non so neanche quelli di Super Mario Bros.).

QUEI GUANTONI LI ODIO CON TUTTO ME STESSO, ti possono fare prese infinite, ti butterranno sempre fuori dal campo, non li puoi schivare, le hitbox sono fatte da un ubriaco, e, questa è un consiglio, se mai qualcuno volesse sfidarmi a BRAWLHALLA e quel qualcuno usa un certo tipo di arma che inizia per P e finisce per UGNI SUPER POTENTI DEL CRISTO IN CROCE, questo QUALCUNO è pregato di disinstallare BRAWLHALLA e fare qualcosa di più costruttivo (come per esempio cercare di far smettere gli altri di usare quei maledettissimi pugni).
--------------------------------------

Secondo punto: ""LE MAPPE""
--------------------------------------

Sono tutte uguali.
Veramente, se non fosse per le texure usate sarebbero identiche.
Niente mappe fantasiose all Smash Bros. dove l'attivazione di qualche evento potrebbe cambiare le sorti del match, no, mappe BLANDE, tutte uguali, l'unica cosa minimamente intrigante è che alcune mappe hanno qualche piattaforma mobile messe seguendo speciali regole di Level Design dette: AD CAZZUM.

Senza contare il fatto che tutte le mappe hanno la peculiarità di essere scentrate.
Vuol dire che in alcune mappe il bordo destro è più corto del sinistro e quello in alto è talmente alto che l'avversaio è morto di vecchiaia aspettando il mio rientro dalla stratosfera
--------------------------------------

Terzo e ultimo punto: ""TUTTO IL RESTO""
--------------------------------------

Ci sono un sacco di altre piccole cose che mi seccano, quindi per il vostro piacere da lettori e il mio piacere da bravo recensore a cui non piace niente, ecco a voi un fantastico elenco puntato:

-I personaggi sono tutti uguali cambiano solo le armi, che palle;
-Gli oggetti nelle ranked, ottimo direi;
-Le armi che spawnano a caso, meno male che puntavano a renderlo competitivo;
-Il salto è talmente squilibrato che ti permette di uscire dai bordi dello schermo e non di poco, quindi, uno usa la
tattica del pidocchio e saltella in giro senza farsi mai colpire, come metanight e ricordiamo tutti come metanight
fosse equilibrato;
-La shivata è una presa in giro, ci sono alcuni attacchi, un bel po' direi, che prendono tutto il campo di battaglia e la schivata
non funziona a meno che tu non la faccia al pelo dell'animazione avversaria;
-L'attacco speciale verso il basso della lancia ha una gittata enorme, non bisogna avere abilità e strategia per farlo, tanto nessuno
può avvicinarsi;
-Uno ti può aspettare al bordo, questo gli regala un'attacco gratis e, se è un demente e non riesce a colpirti, non andrai neanche
tanto lontano e quindi un colpo te lo da di certo;
-Il lupo di Ember è un errore, prende dappertutto e fa male, e io gioco solo Ember;
-Il Minotauro è squilibrato, punto, chi la pensa diversamente è Gay; (E anche oggi ho fatto la mia battuta gay)
-Le ranked in 2 sono un errore, perchè mai uno dovrebbe poter colpire il proprio compagno di squadra, non è evitabile, le mappe sono piccole e ci stanno
4 giocatori che si prendono a botte, è un casino;
-Alcune mappe, oltre ad essere terrificanti, sono ancora peggio, visto che alcune vie di morte sono bloccate o comunque difficili;
-Se sei in aria l'avversario può attaccarti senza che tu abbia la possibilità di difenderti, a meno che tu non abbia la precisione di un chirurgo
e l'avversario stia esattamente sotto di te o tu abbia la lancia, l'unica tattica è schivare o attaccare verso l'alto ma ciò posticipa solo l'inevitabile;
-Se sei sotto la mappa e stai raggiungendo il bordo, uno ti può fare un'attacco verso il basso e ucciderti sul colpo, se solo ci fosse la possibilità di appendersi
per ritornare sul campo di battaglia e fare una sfida equilibrata...;
-Uno non può continuare a spammare la solita mossa e passarla liscia, se una mossa prende da lontano, ci potrebbe anche stare però, come su Super Smash Bros., se
continuo ad usarla dovrebbe perdere di potenza in modo tale da constriggere l'avversario a usare altre mosse, visto che continuare a usare la solita mossa op
potrebbe portare alla sconfitta;
-Le partite a punti sono un oltraggio ad ogni senso del pudore, se si è in 2 d'accordo, ci sta, ma se si è in 3 o più, uno può fare il parassita: lasciare che i 2 più forti 
si menino poi, quando qualcuno ha poca vita, entrare in campo e dargli l'ultimo colpettino e rubare la kill, ripetere per vincere;
-I personaggi sono trasparenti, se sono essattamente su qualcuno(intendo dire esattamente dove sta l'avversario) questo mancherà il colpo, sembra stupido ma è fastidiosissimo
e l'avversario può usare questo bug per colpirti e vincere. E non venitemi a dire che è una strategia, il gioco è una caciarata (casino, per i più fini tra di voi) si capisce poco, a meno che tu non
sia in grado di rallentare il tempo, ti verrà solo di culo
--------------------------------------

Il mio voto è ovviamente NEGATIVO ma continuerò a tenerlo installato perchè sono sicuro che metteranno a posto tutti i problemi e non contnueranno ad aggiungere nuovi personaggi che nessuno a chiesto e che sono uguali ad altri che hanno fatto uscire prima (VERO?????)

P.S. Un altra cosa per cui mi lamento è che sono troppo bravo a questo gioco, ho aperto il culo a tutti i miei amici e nessuno vuole più giocare con me...

non ho più amici

2017-01-27 22:47,"This game plays alot like a Super Smash Brothers game, but does enough different to justify existing. The combat system is a bit simpler with each character having only 3 specials instead of 4 and all the characters sharing from a weapon pool of about 10 or so weapons and you have to pick up a weapon in the area at the start, each time you die or if you take enough of a beating to drop it.

The main draw for me other than gameplay is the quirky cast of warriors each with a unique backstory, although they pull from common archetypes and stereotypes each legend has their own personality and reading all the backstories can be fun in it's own right.

Why are Cowgirl, a Viking, an alien invador, a Jungle Queen, a Knight, etc etc, warriors from different time periods all fighting? Simple they died and Vahalla is the afterlife in this universe or maybe multiverse, but the premise is fun and novel and I enjoy it. A dragon, a minotaur, an Archer with katars, a samurai, a ninja, a monster hunter.......

Verdict: It is a fun game with good gameplay, presentation and lots of personality and it is free to play, though not paying will limit your legend choices weekly you can unlock them all eventually. 90 hours and I've unlocked about a third, but 20 buck isnt a lot for a game either so take your pick.

2017-01-27 19:40,"Despite the negative review, I'll be playing this on and off to see how it develops. Right now it has some glaring problems that mainly revolve around variety. Base movesets are all identical. What character variety there is comes from the weapons that they're assigned - and many of the moves performed with those are shared, as well. The end result is that not a single character in the roster has any kind of mechanic that they can really call their own.
This also applies to the character artstyle - dentical proportions and an abundance of Dreamworks-style smirk, along with copy-pasted movesets combine to rob the characters of any real kind of personality. It doesn't help that they have a very amateurish Newgrounds feel to their appearance.",FALSE
2017-01-27 18:09,"Wait, hold on. Why would anyone waste their time writing a review for a free game? Uh... I don't know.

Brawl...HALLA is a fun game that changes a lot about the smash formula. As a Melee veteran, I can tell you playing this game like Melee is like playing Mario Kart like Mario Party. YOU WILL LOSE IF YOU DARE TO:

Trying to gimp in a game with infinite jumps and no edges is DUMB.

Trying to wavedash is DUMB due to the fact the animation still plays on the ground... leaving you kinda open.

Trying to L-cancel is DUMB.

Rarely using Smash attacks (Strong as there called in this game) is DUMB.

And trying to change your mindset on how to approach an opponent for each character is DUMB.

In this game, animations and lag stay until you're hit or it ends. Meaning you can hit the ground with an aerial and your character will still wift their attack. Smash attacks are fast and EXTREMELY useful in this game because of the fact you can start the attack on an edge and continue the attack OFF-STAGE. 

Heck, characters aren't really different from each other. It is the weapons that you pick up mid-match that determine your playstyle. The only main difference between characters really are their smash attacks(yes, characters can have the same weapon).

So go play the game. Nothing will happen to your game experience if you play with or without pay. Paying is only their to personalize your characters. My only issue is the game simplicity. No advanced tech, no moves with many alternate uses. The game is painfully straightforward for what it is. Brawlhalla is a great name for this game. I guess Rivals of Aether would be Meleehalla and Brawlout would be 64halla. But what would be Smash 4halla?

2017-01-24 15:04,"Pros - Fun casually

Cons - pay2play (lotta grinding if you want everything for free)

         - terrible servers (lotta lag and missed inputs)

         - characters all play very similiar; there are universal unarmed moves and each weapon has a universal basic attack, only difference is the 3 special moves for each character; a side special, a down special, and a nuetral special, which boiled down are meant for knockouts, ground control and air control respectively

         - stats other than attack and defence dont matter due to dodges

         - no stagger after missing an attack - most games would have you stagger or linger for a moment after missing an attack, in this game there seems to be either no or minimal stagger allowing oponents to miss an attack and immediately hit you if you try to punish, though it seems random sometimes

         - power creep - many new characters that have been released completely outclass older characters due to having straight upgrades to the other characters signature moves 

         - hitboxes - the hitboxes in this game are terrible, http://imgur.com/fssJiPg

         -  dodge ""mechanic"" - this makes the hate the game by itself, forget everything else this move kills the game. Generally speaking in fighting games you have to fight the other player by either being aggressive and dishing out punches or being defensive and punishing if the opponent overextends. In this game you have a dodge, which makes you completely invulnerable for a short period of time, not even acknowledging the other players attack allowing you to instantly execute and attack of your own. This makes most ranked games a passive aggressive-fest where 1 person will just wait for the other to finally throw out a move, dodge it and then attack the other. In most other fighting games the game timer will never reach zero, i myself have only ever had it happen once in tekken and never in any other game. In this game ive had many matches reach the 0 mark, and the game timer is 5 minutes compared to street fighter and tekkens 99 seconds. This dodge problem is amplified by there being 2 other dodge types in the game ( i wont go into those).

Overall this game is fun to play casually, and the only good online mode are either the event ones or 4 player FFA, i cant reccommend 1v1 or ranked due to the fundamentally stupid game mechanics.

If it's not the somewhat obvious balancing issues (Insert Metallica Joke Here) and the art-style looking like that of freeclipart.co.uk, it's probably the fuckton of microtransactions (which can basically be mostly ignored if you just buy the 20 dollar version) or the general lack of playability without friends.

However, this game is extremely fun to play with friends and is so obscenely easy-to-run that I'm pretty sure a Raspberry Pi can run it (if you have the time, try that for me thx bb) and the fact that the filesize is so small really helps considering a friend can just yell ""INSTALL BRAWLHALLA FUCCASS"" and you'll be yelling racial slurs in no time.

So, it's fun, easy to run, easy to install, but it's kinda full of microtransactions and has the general feel of a facebook flash game.

Pros
-lots of characters
-lots of maps
-lots of weapons
-free

Cons
-absolutely pathetic gift to the people who helped found this game (all characters unlocked, but there's NOT that many characters... or variety of characters... and you don't even get skins for them. At least, I don't know, founder skins for all characters? [We founders paid 20$ for the game... I could have bought all the smite characters for the same price!]
-online is a nightmare (either you find someone bad at the game, or you find someone who lives in this game, and beats you without breaking a sweat.)
-horrid weapon mechanics
-scarcely any variety in characters (save stats)

It is a great way to spend afternoon with friends, sure, but you will quickly tire of the same attack types.

Of course, after you've learnt the basics, it's time to head over to the online matches...where you will find spammers in the casual games and, as a South African, game ruining latencies if you decide to head to ranked (as usual, we are completely left out when it comes to servers...).
Not fun at all watching your attacks miss, your opponent seemingly teleport around the screen and the complete and utter inability to dodge even the most obvious of charged up heavy attacks...when you do manage to pull off a dodge, you'll quickly find yourself at the mercy of what seems to be a delayed hitbox with your character being rolled back to a previous position. Absolutely avoid this game if you have any desire to even try and play online - you'll quickly find yourself in a losing streak that you cannot get out of without physically moving somewhere in Europe.

I'll continue having fun with it as a couch co-op, and it is free, so I suppose it's fine to pick up and play for a short while.",FALSE
2016-12-18 19:36,"Brawlhalla is a F2P fighting game. More specifically, it's a Platform Fighter game in the same vein as Smash Brothers. Anyone familiar with the Super Smash Brothers series should be able to hop into this game with relative ease, and anyone who doesn't have experience with ANY games like these shouldn't have a hard time either. It's relatively straightforward, but the key difference that sets it apart from Smash is that it's item-based. 

In Brawlhalla, your default weapon is your fists. You suck with your fists. You have barely any range, your attacks come out slow, and you don't do a lot of damage. Every character in the game has the exact same moveset with their fists. What you're supposed to do is pick up the weapons strewn about the battlefield. Once you get a weapon pickup, you'll randomly be assigned one of two different weapons depending on your character. Lord Vraxx for example can get Guns or a Rocket Lance. Thatch can get a Sword or a Gun. With a weapon, your moveset changes accordingly. Everyone's basic attacks with a weapon are the same (two different characters who both use guns will have similar base movesets) but there is a strong attack button that gives you access to your Signatures, which are like Smash attacks. Every character has 6 signatures (down, side, and neutral - three for each weapon). Using your regular attacks to rack up damage on the opponent and finishing them off with your signature techniques is the key to success here. 

The fact that all the same weapons have the same basic attacks regardless of who you're playing as means that characters do initially feel much less unique than the rosters in other games like Rivals of Aether, but as a result the game is noticeably more balanced than most and there's more emphasis on individual player skill over the character you're playing. The weapons actually all feel really satisfying to use, and in the right hands you can pull off some pretty insane stuff with them. Feel free to pick a character with weapons you like. There's a viking, a rock dude, a monk, a pirate, and an alien overlord, among others. Gameplay is fluid and tight, and the netcode is surprisingly good.

The soundtrack is actually pretty tight too. Nothing's AMAZING but the music is pretty enjoyable to listen to, and the sound effects for each attack feel good, really sound like they hit hard and seriously add to the overall experience

The game itself is free to play, with a free rotation of heroes each week. You can earn coins through regular play to unlock heroes permanently, but you can easily play and enjoy it all without spending a dime. Compared to games like League and Smite the like, unlocking characters with coins is pretty generous because you'll likely only dedicate yourself to 2 characters at a time (unlike a MOBA where you'd need to learn several so you can fit into a team comp) 

In addition there's a huge assortment of cosmetic items which you can purchase with real money if you desire. Weirdly enough I openly welcome the amount of cosmetic content there is. Every hero has at least 3 skins, and then there's alternate weapon skins you can get, KO effects, taunts, and sidekicks. The extra customization is nice for anyone who's willing to shell out for it, but if you don't then you're at no more of a disadvantage than anybody else (at least unless you feel like looking ugly is disadvantageous).

Partly due to it being F2P, the playerbase is surprisingly healthy. Casual online modes consist of Free For All (4 player brawls) and 1v1 Strikeout (three lives, but each life is a different character). For those who are a little more competitive, there's 1v1 Ranked and 2v2 Ranked. 2v2 in particular is a nice addition, as I find climbing with a friend and being able to wombo combo the enemy into oblivion to be immensely satisfying. I faced some toxicity at lower levels of play (Bronze to low Silver, really) but as I climbed I've met some really cool people. Much like any other fighting game, this requires some quick reflexes and split-second decision making, which may not be present in everyone and if you're not used to this sort of thing it may not be for you. Luckily there's a training mode which lets you work on certain things and gives analysis on attacks, framedata and hitbox info.

My only problem would be the art, and it's more like a personal preference than anything else. The art isn't bad, but it resembles something seen from a Facebook game and makes it seem kind of...cheap? The game itself thankfully has a lot of value to it but the art style may turn some people away. The developers are luckily very open and transparent, and take feedback from the community on many internet discussion boards.

I enjoyed this game in beta because the only people that could play it were people who were selected, or people that bought it, and they didnt want to lose that access. Now people could care less about what happens.
How to fix these problems:
Advertise more. make it a .99$ game (Thats basiclly a joke because theres no way you would)
Make chat accessible in game and an option to turn it completly off in the options.
Make a report function that puts toxic players on cooldown for ranked, and make it a progressive cooldown.

If you want a serious game, go somewhere else. This is the land of shenanigans of silliness.
I mean, where else can a viking, a space alien, and a minotaur fight it out? ...
Well yeah, theres HotS... But that doesn't count.

So anyway, what is the game like? It's word for word, a Smash Bros clone in terms of gameplay. You probably know the drill if you are an avid gamer. Punch someone until you somehow gain the power to punch em with enough force to make them explode. But just to spice things up is how the game handles items. You pick up a sword and instead of just changing a few of your attacks, your whole play style changes. It's honestly a nice shake up to the formula. I just wish I didn't keep forgetting that some directional attacks don't work(like, there is no neutral strong. I mean, there's no neutral smash in Smash bros, but I keep treating heavy attacks like Smash's special moves).

Currently the big selling point is the game's pretty big character list at about 27 right now. There are plenty of game modes but besides snowbrall, strikeout, and the basic time and stock matches they aren't too much to write about unless you get some companions. A small issue I have is the lack of other items, but considering you can't pick up an item and a weapon I can see why there are so few of them.

Personally, I'd recomend getting the All-Legends Pack if you want to just play this game. Twenty dollars is a fair enough price so long as you have internet or local friends.
Or you could satisfy your cravings for bonus stuff with the Collectors pack. It's kind of expensive, but if you're the guy who really loves cosmetics the aproximate $100 worth of in game cash included with it is worth considering. Also you get a robot butler thing! Who doesn't love those?",TRUE

Brawlhalla is a free to play brawler which is essentially a platform fighter. Brawlhalla is  not one of those ""pay to win"" money grubbing games, its a pay to look pretty money grubbing game. theres a difference.
In singles you can have a good time and win some games, lose some games, but in doubles its a constant cluster fuck of your friend (Henry) beating the shit out of you with bombs (again... Henry). However if you're looking for a good time, Brawlhalla makes a great party game, a great game to play with friends, and most importantly a great game to play alone. Now lets address the the elephant in the room, the community. Bralhalla HAD a great community, it was smll but it was loyal and forgiving, but now im noticing a lot of CS:GO players playing Brawlhalla and honestly its ruining it. after every loss now you hear things like ""SCRUB, bad, kys, drink bleach, i hope your mother gets cancer"" ya know fun stuff like that, if you want a game with a nice community i would not reccomend this game as it grows to become more toxic than League of legends. But none the less its a fun game to play with friends (unless you have a henry) so get ready to play the most addicting game you have ever played and climb the ranks to become the best. and remember...

[*]Easy to learn
[*]Lots of legends
[*]Easy to use party system

Cons:

2016-03-27 8:32,"As much as i want to recommend this game, i really cant. it's a fun game that's easy to pick up and fun to play with friends, it's a fighting game that has depth but at the same time it doesn't require you to memorise combos so new players and fighting game enthusiasts can play on a similar level from the beginning as it's more about reflexes and reactions than remembering combos. The art style is nice to look at and all the characters have there own twist.

There is one simple reason why i cant recommend this game or the developers. I paid for this game and it's full of micro transactions, rather than making more real content to the game, the developers would rather just ship out more skins every update just to cash in, which is disgusting. this game would have so much more content if even a fraction of the time put into making skins was put into something else, even just new levels or maybe a few new weapons.

The sad thing is, i doubt i'll ever be able to recommend this game, because microtransactions are a sign that the developers dont make a game to make it fun, they do it to make money, and it's a spit into the face of players. i'm fine with microtransactions for games that are free to play like league of legends, smite and dota 2, because all of those games have a TON of content which is free to be enjoyed by everyone.

Edit: i just saw on the store page that there is a edition of the game that costs £80, and all it has is some money for microtransations and some skins, do they really think that their game is worth £80?",FALSE

The only downside to this is the games buisness model. I got into it with the All Ledgend pack.

The support for the game is phenomal as well. They address all concerns and complaints in a timely manner.

Needless to say I found myself wanting to support it. So much so that I purchased the founder's pack. I will be a long time player and I am about to go play some 2v2 with a friend. 

What I would like to see is a bit more variety in the dropped items. Perhaps something that holds you in place for a moment like a freeze move, or something that poisons you and applies a DOT for a while. The possibilities are endless, and that's what's so great about the game. The four that are currently implemented are great, but different playlists with seperate item sets would be cool.

I do recommend this game for anyone who likes fast paced brawlers, if you are a fan of the Super Smash Bros franchise (is it a franchise or would it be considered like a series or something? whatever it doesnt matter) you would certainly love this game. I personally believe that if more is added to this game such as more legends(characters), gamemodes, weapons, gadgets, etc. This game could become as good as, if not better then super smash bros.
I give this game a 6-7/10 as it is now but im sure if more is added than that score will increase.
 
Major pros
Fast paced smash bros like combat with less accidental knocking yourself off the edge due to a more useful recovery.
different weapons to change up your combat style mid-round.
leveling system on your profile and each individual character so you feel like your making progress
Online and local play so u can play with people across the world or in the same room

Major cons
Each character is about the same with only the unique combination of 2 weapons to really change there playstyle
leveling system is bland without any major upgrades

2015-08-19 17:12,"Brawlhalla; An online Steam version of Smash Brothers, if you will. Like plenty of other all-out multiplayer fighting games, your outlook on this game really depends on your outlook of fighting games in general; If you're a competitive player, you'll probably be a nuisance and complain about the slightest flaws in the games, characters or level design and get turned off my minor issues like that. If you play for fun, however, you'd enjoy the multiplayer experience alongside the fact that it is able to be played with a controller, so no keyboard troubles for you (that is, if you have the USB corb & controller)! The characters are notably memorable from the gnarly ""overpowered"" Gnash to the hustling ""surprisingly female"" Hattori. Each have their own different weapon choices, which makes for different scenarios and unique battles, so long as you don't annoyingly and unnecessarily complain about their ""being overpowered"" or flaws, as that's personal and others can totally prove you wrong. As of now, new characters are being added to the shop, alongside the prior DLC in the forms of Valkris, (as you spell it in-game) weapon skins and costume skins. Each one is unique, and if you got some spare money or would care to costume up some of your personal favorite Brawlhalla characters, go for it! A few bucks would be worth it on a unique look. The recently-new level system made it so that you could obtain gold, skin colors and prior stances for each character. The only problem with the leveling system can get quite tedious a certain of levels in, it's still worth it for some prior stances, skin colors and gold for future characters. They have a ranking system and just a 'for fun' online free-for-all option. The ranking system goes from bronze and progresses a few gems up, and just try not to get frustrated as if you lose, you're likely to get deranked depending on your rank. One notable advantage from Brawlhalla opposed to Smash Brothers is the lack of long updates required to go online and the relative ease of being able to connect online and join a room with friends, not to mention it's quite easy to drop out and spectate. Although Brawlhalla is still being updated and some of the stages are either opinionatedly bland, trippy, or just ""frustrating"", Brawlhalla is an amazing Steam versioned substitute for Smash Brothers, and although it isn't quite as good, it is definitely worth the $13 purchase. Keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and outlook of the game, so if you have your own, feel free to let me know! 9/10; A Clauds recommended online Smash Brothers :]",TRUE

-Great game for both the competetive and the casual player
-Highly addicting
-Exciting and quick gameplay
-Smooth controls
-Great server stability
-Colorful graphics
-Seemingly balanced gameplay
-Easy to understand leveling system
-Tons of unlockables
-Great F2P model that looks as though unlocking champions will be fairly easy for the true F2Per once the game is officially released
-Grinding for in game currency is fun and easy, matches dont last that long


CONS:

-Playing with a controller may make things slightly easier.
-I have to exit the game when real world issues come up.


Seriously if you like this style of game I would pick it up.  Worth the price even though it will be free to play in a few months.  Get yourself a headstart and get good before the release.  Get out there and kick some butt and have some fun!",TRUE
2015-08-01 14:33,"Amazing game. Exception being the fact that if you try to play any long games (upwards of ten minutes) it will inevitably freeze right before the game ends. When the timer is at the 1:30 or 2 minute mark. It has happened without fail 5 times in a row shortly before im writing this. once this is fixed the game will be so much better.

2015-07-31 13:27,"This game has a great feel to it like Smash Bro's. I find this game is more balanced in character abilities and does take skill to win. Game is balanced better against someone spamming moves, we all know that friend! and it wont play to there game strategy like other games. You have a lot of movement in the game from double jumps to a dodge that can be done in mid air, so you get pounded by hammer off the platform, it might not be over yet! this is a lot of 4 player max would love to see it eventually have 8 player maps and 8 player fighting I already have 7 friends who bought it after me, would love to play with all them at once. You have two weapon styles each characters are different you have spears,hammers,axes,rocket lance,pistols,etc and all of them have pro's and con's depending what your fighting with. There are also bombs,proxy mine,spike ball,etc that you can throw at players, will be great to see what they implement in the future this game is worth buying and is super fun. Try it out.",TRUE

Characters have different weapons and the weapons have different combos, different speeds and stats and I believe there is not much luck to it, but skill. 
It's just like the old Super Smash Bros, but different none the less. So if you liked Super Smash Bros I definitely suggest you Brawlhalla, as I'm enjoying this game quite a lot.",TRUE

2015-07-26 18:11,"Well after playing around with this game for 9 hours. I felt I got enough of the game to form a review. 

Brawlhalla is a fighting game like that of super smash bros. By that I mean you try to dish out enough damage onto your opponents until they are weak enough to deliever a final blow that will knock them off the edge of the map or screen to their deaths. But where this game differ is in the use of the weapons. Each character in the Brawlhalla cast have 2 sets of main weapons they can use. These weapons are the sword, spear, hammer, twin blades, twin guns, axe, lance. Now these weapons may have different skins or looks but they handle in a very similar way. Each character have heavy and light attacks they can perform with these weapons and the speed and powers of these weapons vary from character to character. Also each character have their own stats for their weapons. I won't comment on this, since this beta is in use so developers can see which character still need balancing, but from this current patch (v1.14.0) I'm on it seem to be coming along nicely.

You can still melee and attack without your main weapons, but you feel naked without them. There also items like spike balls, mines, and bombs to throw at opponent if you don't have a weapon in hand. Honestly the combat feel solid, and the use of the weapons make this game stand out from Super Smash Bros. Visually the game looks great, and the levels look fine. I guess my only real complaint is that I wish there was more maps or more variations between each map. But again I know this a beta, and most likely there will be more to come.

All in all, I'm glad the PC gamers now have a fighting game that is as fun as Super Smash Bros to play on their PC.",TRUE

2015-07-21 11:05,"You'd at first expect it to be a mere Smash Clone, but it manages to be unique enough that it's own game entirely. Your skills from Smash won't carry over too well. As opposed to Smash in which you have one constant moveset and an array of generally annoying items, Brawlhalla gives you three rapidly changing movesets with items that are considerably more fair to it's target. That being said, characters are not too terribly unique or memorable. You are more likely to remember them as the fast ninja one, the steampunk girl, and so forth. It still is a beta, so they may flesh out the characters more as we approach a official release.

TL;DR
A very unique take on the platform fighter genre, but don't expect too much in terms of character personality.",TRUE
2015-07-21 1:18,"I was looking into supporting the development of this game as I love the crazy and random fun of Smash Brothers. I am not a competative player by any means. I like to just sit on the couch and play with some friends who don't take the game too seriously. Given that, this is my review of Brawlhalla, a game that many claim is very similar to SSB.

The short review: I got a refund. ""It isn't fun"".

I can't consciously recommend this game to fans of Smash Brothers, any of them. The issue lies in the characters and the developer choice to make all the characters EXACTLY the same. Literally they all share the same 2D skeletal animations. There will be no boswers or other larger characters or even smaller characters (unless scaled which would be appalling). They all have the same default attacks from what I can tell. They all can change their stats before a match making their appearance WORTHLESS. You might have fought the same guy as an agile fighter, but the next time you play he will be a heavy brawler. This makes no sense and kills the fun. The fact they have so many characters of this EXACT SAME TYPE and it is Beta leads me to believe they have no intention of changing this.

Also, there are no cues on almost anything in the game. It is mass confusion and not in the fun interesting way Smash Bros is. 

If you are looking for items to use against your opponents... there are three, maybe four in the entire game. Bomb, sticky bomb, and spike ball. The rest are one of your two weapons, which are not unique to your character. It would be a thousand times better if you could use any weapon and the characters you are fighting with just get suped up attacks for using the weapons they are experienced with, leading to interesting gameplay between players on the screen, instead you get indistinguishable swords which could mean: guns, hammers, knives, staves, etc, and even swords, but these are all dependent on which character you pick, because it will only be one of their two weapons. That is the only thing that defines the characters in this game besides their voices which don't stand out much when they move and act like every other character.

You are basically picking load-outs of the range of weapons when you pick a character, which is very disappointing. 

After being recommended this game I played a little of it then went over to a friend’s place to asking him why I just wasted my money. We played about an hour and a half on his machine, but I was totally bored. I have seen everything in the game by that time and it is disappointing. I am getting a refund until this game finally includes something interesting worth the money.

Pros:
- basic smash bros style combat.
- There are a few levels?

Cons:
- Characters can be smashed by some characters attacks sometimes, but not others at the same ""health"". I am assuming the characters have different stats but there is no way to tell.
- One character with different loadouts and skins - no personalities
- Uninspired level design - just platforms
- Confusing and bland audio design for a genre that needs to be bombastic
- A baffling lack of items
- Most of what you want to see out of this game is missing

Now, before people get too upset with this review, I know this is Beta, but we are still reviewing a Beta, if the game improves I will be revisiting it again later, but right now it garners a negative review. Yes, you have damage represented in percentage and a few items scattered around the levels, but this lacks some rudimentry things I am looking for in a SSB clone that other indie developers have done in the past. This game also lacks rudimentary visual cues for players which makes it hard to enjoy when that fast agile player you stomped can pick the same character and fix their stats between matches. Or out of nowhere you get slammed out of the arena while not quite near 100% by a character who didn't charge an attack before you got there. 

I have to ask while playing this, ""Why did that happen?"" then guess that the player changed their stats between games, got lucky or that I got two characters confused because their silhouettes are almost identical on the screen. There is very little visually that will clue you in on to why something is happening, and that isn't the random variety I was expecting.",FALSE
2015-07-17 3:50,"This game is absolutely awesome, challenging and brings back memories of super smash bros. But what would be awesome to see is the ability to create your own character or at least tweak the stats of some people. Also a type of mission or campaign would be awesome to see as well and I bet would bring alot more people in if there connection or computer is not the best for online!",TRUE
2015-07-15 20:07,"An adequately fun time-waster if you have a couple of friends around with nothing better to do, but it lacks technical depth and diversity. It's trying to straddle a middle-ground between the clean & beautiful simplicity of titles like Samurai Gunn and the technical intricacy of Smash Bros., and what's happened instead is that if feels lukewarm on all accounts.

The ""weapon system"" is interesting at a glance, but it trivializes character choice and simplifies gameplay to the equivalent of a Smash Bros. match where beam swords and baseball bats spawn perpetually all over the stage and can be casually discarded with little to no recourse.

If you're looking for something simliar, try out Samurai Gunn and keep your eyes peeled for Rivals of Aether.",TRUE

Without the publicity of a mainstream brawler like smash, I really hope people will start to notice this game. Getting a bigger and better communtity would be amazing, and once it's out of beta, I hope thats what will happen.

Fun and unique characters
Fun casual gametypes, and intense ranked 1v1s

I get irrationally mad because I suck and this game tends to piss me off more often than not which is a compliment. I keep playing though finding ways to stop being dumb.

2015-06-10 21:50,"Hours put into the game so far: Approximately 3. 
My current review of the game: Positive

Remember those days of playing on a 20 inch CRT television, Surge, Nintendo 64/TV/Body heat heating up the room , 4 sweaty teenagers yelling and cursing jumping up and down after every victory or loss?

No? Maybe that was my childhood. I loved the Nintendo 64. The 4 controller ports made it the party system of the times. Gauntlet Legends, Goldeneye, Mario Kart 64, and finally Super Smash Brothers. Smash Brothers was the game to play. It was something new where 4 people used one screen to fight each other unlike Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. There was no blood, there especially wasn't graphics... Just Nintendo-themed nostalgia while you smack each other off the stage. Until today, there was nothing like this on the PC. Companies have tried and failed. Megabyte punch? Rag Doll Kung Fu? Not even close.

Today, we have Brawlhalla. A four player game with a name deserving the title it represents. Blue Mammoth Games is a company forged right out of my own hometown of Atlanta. Recently, they attended MomoCon to which I had the pleasure of attending. There they showcased this game. At the time, I was too busy running around doing other things. I saw a small group of people gathered around the 2 stations, but I never gave it a second thought. I later heard the game was going to be free to play. After the con (and my ridiculous Smash Brothers Tournament loss), I still had an itch to play games like that. I looked this game up on Steam. $13 for a founders pack is nothing to turn down. That is a wonderful price. I still had a few days left before Duck Game came out, so I took the liberty to purchase Brawlhalla to get into the beta. I have zero regrets. 

The game is an Offline/Online brawler similar to Smash Brothers. However, the game doesn't base stats on percentage. You don't even really see your health bar. Its in the far upper right out of the screen so you can see the huge stage and where your body rag dolls off to. I used Xbox 360 controllers to play. The buttons, while up does not jump, are also similar to SSB. Up + attack, Down + attack, charge attack, shield roll... They are all familiar and work so well. The sound effects really boost this every time you charge an attack and nail a return frequent flyer with a *THWACK*. I especially love the right angles they use to boost the direction you want to send someone. 

As of right now there are only a handful of characters and maps: 14 characters and 9 maps. However, the dev team isn't trying to take your money here. They are constantly adding new additions and new features. You can play the different kill modes: Timed, Stock, Brawlball, or Bombsketball. I have only tested timed and Stock at this review. Online play works flawlessly and I have honestly never seen any real lag. 

Soon, the game will come out of beta and they will no longer charge to get in. It will be free to play. You can't lose with free. All you can do is buy all the clothes and make sure the development team gets as much money as they need to make games as good as this in the future. 

TL;DR Buy in to the beta if you enjoy Smash Brothers!",TRUE
2015-06-10 19:14,Really fun to play with friends. :3,TRUE
2015-06-08 23:05,"YES. YES. YES.  This game kicks ass.  Literally.  

Despite the comparason to Super Shash Bros, this game isn't a clone of SSB.  It comes into its own and really blows you away.  Fantastic game.  Haven't been so happy about a fighting game since my time with Blade Symphony!

Controls: FINALLY a game that doesn't use Up on L stick (Yes, I use a 360pad) as jump!  Controls are smooth and responsive.  Simple, but very effective.

Characters: Each character is unique via special moves interweaved with normal weapon moves.  I don't know what the F2P model will be (I bought the game on a whim and MAN am I happy I did) but at the moment all the characters are free.  There is quite a selection and you won't be dissapointed.  

Gameplay: Fast, Frantic, and Fantastic!  There are spammers (especially with swords--SWORD SPAMERS T.T) but it is relatively easy to couter when you fight it constantly (such is the hell of bronze 2).  Aside from the spammers the combat is amazing and varied.  I cannot stress enough how important the dodge feature is.  Without this feature the spammers would really have the upper hand and the whole game would suffer.  LEARN HOW TO DODGE!  (pro tip: don't dodge after you see an attack dodge when there is an attack coming--learn how to anticipate when someone is going to attack)

After reaching Silver in Ranked 1v1, I stopped playing Ranked and will only play with my friends now. Why? Simple: everybody being obnoxious turds. If someone gets knocked out of the arena, going around and throwing the weapons to make them unusable, which puts the recovering player at a major disadvantage, is just annoying and utterly unfair. It also doesn't help that the ""invincibility"" that's given when someone is recovered doesn't protect them from being knocked around.

I've owned the game for a while, and it was a great experience my first few times playing it, but I started to get bored because each character used the same exact attacks if they were holding the same weapon (with one unique attack as an exception).

Recent patches have started adding unique moves to characters, and it made the whole game way better. Characters feel more distinct and unique, and it makes choosing a favorite character more meaningful (and mastering that character more rewarding)!

I've never been much of a competitive person, but playing ranked 1v1 in Brawlhalla gets my blood pumping. I'm peaking right on the verge of the Silver tier, but I love being in a ranked mode because every match I play is against someone close to my skill level, so every fight challenges me to play my best.

Postitives:
-Similar to Super Smash Bros
-Easy to learn, and difficult to master
-Perfect game to play with a couple friends
-Fast paced
-Well balanced

Negatives, most of which is simply because it's beta:
-Few items (2 weapons, a mine, a bomb, a spike-ball, and a war horn)
-Few types of weapons (Sword, Hammer, Lance, Spear, Blades, Guns, and Axe, with every character limited to 2 of these)
-Combos/movesets are too similar for bare-handed and weapon combat.
-Choosing your favorite character mostly boils down to only who you think looks the coolest and which 2 weapons you are best at using

Although there are a couple cons though such as skins and taunts being purchasable with real money. I would like to see this feature evolve from being only gettable through paying, maybe something like after sooo many matches with a character you can choose a random box and that box will have a skin pack for your character youve been using. Although I do understand them having it right now due to it being in beta and probably needing funding I would like to see it change in the future. One feature that I am extreemly posetive that everyone will pleed for is workshop, If you add steam workshop capabilities to this game then it will sell like theres no tomorrow and by that i mean let us create our own characters and maps then upload them to workshop for other people to download even if its not new characters its just skins for characters it would still be nice to have. It could be like contagion or left 4 dead with the workshop where to play the map everyone needs the map installed but the skins are only client side. all in all I give it a 9/10 for the quality and amazement of this game for just being in beta and I feal that it is going to be amazing when its fully release...ps I love the ability for local play like on the same computer but also having online( it's sadly a feature that we need to see more of to make our single player exsperience more freindly where you can sit with some palls)",TRUE

-Great art style and smooth visuals. Some what cartoony but not too childish

-No pay to win aspects w/ unlocking characters/items. (All store items are purely cosmetic)
-The cosmetics items (Hats) are nice! There is a Jet Set Radio costume/set for one character... Nuff said
-Still in Beta stages showing potential for large roster additions plus consistent balancing and shifting of current meta-game and tier-list
-Solid experience thus far w/ latency and net-code. (It should be noted that I live in Atlanta, GA where their dedicated US server is located)

2015-03-05 3:56,"This game is still on release, but it's... awesome now, if you know what I mean.

You pick one Legend and go fight on an 2D arena. Each Legend has two of the six total weapons available, and each Legend has a unique special move with each of that two weapons. Then you brawl till the time ends or that's only one stantiding. You can use your weapons, throw them to cause damage and ""delay"" the opponent, you can dodge, and there are the items that spaws in the map: bombs, sticky mines, a thornball, and even a nord berrante that summon a running valkyrie.

It may be a little hard to ""get the way"" of this game, however it only takes a few matches for you to understand the basic mechanics.

It's super fun to play with friends(4 players maximum), and others can spectate in real-time while you play. If none of your friends are online, you can play single player in quick matches or Tournament, a competition of 3 rounds featuring you against 3 bots each time. There is a ""MISSIONS"" button that is unavailable, so I'm sure we'll have more single player options in th future. For now, one flaw is that the bots get very easy when you get the grasp of the game(although they're not ""super dumb"", they're just easier than a average player)

You can buy skins for your characters(with real money), and each skin comes with unique skins for its weapons. You can also buy skins for the weapons itself and taunts, and this is the only time you'll spend money in the game after you get it. No pay to win, no ""oh I'm a millionaire so i'll be super stronga"" sh!ts. 

It also pops up super rapido when you start it on Steam; no introducing loading screen, no developer logo, just WELCOME! TO BRAWLHALLA!

So here's my general opinions:

-Very fun;
-You have 13 Legends that you can choose. Although there is only 6 weapons(and each Legend has 2), each Legend has somewhat unique abilities, varying from: left mouse buttom, right mouse buttom, right mouse button + directional, right mouse button in the air + up directional...
-You can play with your friends (up to 4, free for all or teams) and even ranked matches. The online is still buggy sometimes, but just SOMETIMES;
-It can be really ""addictive"" when you learn how to play, because you have many characters and we'll propably going to have more;
-Once you got the game, the only thing you pay for is character/weapon skins and taunts, it's not pay to win - real money do not give gaming advantages;
-Music is very nice - speaking for myself, I like the soundtrack a lot;
-Some bugs here and there that may come up occasionally, but you'll find them very rarely;",TRUE

2015-01-17 12:51,"Immensely fun. Great for local co-op with 2 or 3 friends. If you were looking for a Smash Bros equivalent, this is really as close as we can get right now.

Pros: 
1) Great art style
2) Guaranteed ""Oh man, did that just happen?!"" moments in every match. It's super entertaining to double KO your opponents with one charged move.
3) Tight controls that are great for beginners but very deep and rewarding for people that take the time to master them.
4) Numerous characters with great artwork and decent animation.
5) The different weapon types have very distinct styles and mastery of each is integral to staying in the ring.
6) Local Co-op as well as Online multiplayer.

Cons:
1) Buying a skin for a weapon besides the lance seems somewhat pointless since most matches have the camera extremely zoomed out. For instance, on a 50"" HDTV at 1080p, you can't really tell the difference between some of the cosmetic weapon skins.
2) Even though the artwork is distinct, the camera in 1 can be a problem. The colors don't pop as well as I think they should to differentiate from different players.
3) More weapon type variations would be nice. 

The cons definitely do not detract enough from the game to make this anything but a strong recommendation. I'm hoping they find a way to release cosmetics that are worthwhile to pay for and tighten up the camera.",TRUE
2015-01-13 16:06,"Very fun Smash Bros style 4 player fighting game, however bear in mind the netcode is basically broken at the moment and the bots have special needs, so really unless you can easily arrange some local action I'd keep your money for now",TRUE
2015-01-11 9:06,"Albeit still in beta this game shows so much potential. First and foremost this is because the dedication the developers put into it, which is directly apparent. Everything from layout, interface, (soon to be) legends and their facebook etc show that they plan on sparing no expenses here and want this game to become as big as possible.

At first I was taken back by the 2D cartoon graphics, I was afraid this would be some cheesy newgrounds-ish flash game, but I funded it anyways because I'm a sucker for brawlers. BUT, I was fraught in vain; s someone else wrote in their review here, the graphics were bloopin crisp, with detailed effects and motions. Also I love the artstyle.

Since this is in beta there are of course alot of content missing and alot of touching up to be done but I am impressed with how much they have done with yet so little. Me and my girlfriend have had hours of fun. So what I am hoping to see more of in the future is:

- Some touching up of the controls. I play with a 360 controler and have been loving the responsiveness but there are a few instances when jumping from ground have not responded as I would like it to. Perhaps jumping could cancel the longer attack moves?

- More character unique moves. I guess that has to be one of the more time consuming aspects to make but the game could relly benefit from having more moves to learn etc. as we all do love learning and timing special moves in games as tekken and street fighter.

- I would love to see more statistics when playing online. I love competetive gaming and to be able to track and record how well I'm doing against others, trying to beat them, it could keep me playing for hours on end.

- and of course a metric mega tonne of more content, characters, maps and skins.

Some cool design decisions:
* Lots of recovery options, so you can almost always get where you want to go on the stage, but if you get hit, you get hit pretty hard.
* Each character has two weapons available, so you can switch your moveset mid-match (item spawns willing) to try to improve your match-up.

-Nice visual experience, even if the animation is skelleton-like.
-Easy and quick matchup in netplay, and very simple but effective ""custom online"" to play with friends.
-In-game coins free when buying the early access.
-Controller friendly.

Cons:
-Feels buggy so far, but runs well.
-Some characters are not often used in online matches.
-In-game coins are always bought with real money and not won in matches, and skins are a bit too expensive for the coins to be real money.
-Needs better character dubbing to immprove the experience.
-Only the buyer receives the benefits when buying the friends pack.

Things that should be improved:
-Cheaper skins and stuff.
-More items apart from bombs, mines, horns and spike balls.
-Add more weapons per char (for example, each character can choose 2 out of 3 for the match).
-Winning coins by winning matches.

2014-11-17 20:54,"[First Impression Review - will be modified as my experience with the title increases/changes.]

Once upon a time, the Norse Gods of Video Games brought a bunch of people from various times to Brawlhalla, their castle in the clouds where battles always rage for the Aesir's delight!

Brawlhalla is heavily based on the Smash Bros. franchise for the Nintendo systems.  The goal of the game varies slightly based on game mode, but it usually involves hitting your opponents to make them fly farther...then, knocking them off of the stage.

Based on my training session, it appears that the items aren't as bad as the Nintendo Smash games - usually, in the Nintendo games, there are a bunch of useless or nigh-useless items that get strewn about on the field that don't really have a great deal of value.  In Brawlhalla, this is very nicely averted by the guardians leaving weapons.  Be very mindful what you pick up, because it influences your character's fighting style!  The implication of this is that you can change styles mid-fight...provided your opponent can't reason you strategy.

As I'm making this review, though, I'm doing so with less than 24 hours in-game.  That's a little low, right?  Well, this game isn't all sugar and rainbows.

The level design is rather bad; it's not quite to Final Fantasy XIII levels of awfulness, but I can sum up the existing levels in a set of broad statistics: ""25% land, 75% pit.""  There are no maps like Hyrule Temple where you have a bunch of terrain options.  There are no periodic hazards you can use to your advantage.  The arenas are extremely bland, to the point of being lifeless and vanilla.

Another problem, at least for some, is that microtransactions exist in this game.  The developers seem to be aware of how much microtransactions are abused, becuase they've taken steps to ensure that only heroes or cosmetic changes can be bought.  They've learned the lessons of the modern games industry and the games audience well!  NEVER SELL POWER!!!

PROS:
+ Remappable controls
+ Quick support - my control issues were resolved within two days by a developer!
+ Great visuals
+ Great music
+ Feels like a Nintendo Smash game
+ Pickups are nearly always useful (Nintendo, Mr. Saturn does not belong in a Smash game.  Sorry.)
+ Mallhalla is the best Norse-inspired pun I have yet read in a game.
+ The microtransaction store only sells cosmetic upgrades, it doesn't sell power.

CONS:
- The current stages are 75% pit, 25% land
- The current stages are soulless arenas, not imagination-inspiring battlefields
- At the time of this writing, there are only a handful of weapons and characters.

This is a fun multiplayer brawler that has supreme potential to be just as awesome as the Nintendo Smash Bros. games, only for the PC Master Race!  I can tentatively recommend this game, with the caveat that this game is Early Access, so you're taking a risk by investing in it.  Pray that the developers come through on their end of this great game-to-be.",TRUE
2014-11-14 11:24,"Brawlhalla is a 2D brawler game, emulating the stlye of Super Smash Bros but adds it's own little spin and feel to the genre like, having a weapon system that modifies your characters attacks. Each character being able to wield one of two weapons that randomly drop in the map, but at the cost of not being able to grab anything else like mines, spiked balls and other items. The characters have their own stats and are pretty much the same moveset wise, unless when they have their weapons equipped then the get a unique neutral smash attack.

Now in beta, with added characters and music tracks, the game itself is more enjoyable. Smoother animations, more weapons, diversity in the cast, the weapons and the soundtrack and now a ""market"" ala LoL (League of Legends) with minor things, like skins and taunts, but not essencial. With no hint of Pay2Win in the horizon the future is a bright one for Brawlhalla.

Though not everything is positive, the Arcade mode is basically tournament mode but with bots and no difficulty choice, the online mode is a bit scarce ( I have yet to fight online, no idea if it's due to my timezone or if nobody plays the online ), and making everyone have the same moveset, except when they have weapons which ONLY grants them one move that distinguishes them from the rest, is a bit lack luster but does make skill a much bigger factor in winning a match and not if a character is top tier or not.

In conclusion, Brawlhalla is a very good F2P 2D Brawler that has the potencial to become a great game, it's colourful cast and maps are great and wonderfull soundtrack make it pop out in the mixt of brawlers who want to be like Smash Bros and add nothing new to the genre. I'd recommend anyone who likes 2D Brawlers to give this game a whirl, by buying the founders pack, and keep their eyes open for the updates that the dev team is pushing out.

2014-10-31 23:36,Great game. It reminded me of if Castle Crashers and Super Smash Brothers had a love child. Enjoying the game with friends and hope to see many updates!,TRUE
2014-10-30 18:34,"I enjoy Brawlhalla. Below are my poorly organized thoughts on the game and the direction I would like see the development take. 

--------------

- I’m slightly concerned as the upcoming update seems to deal with introducing more characters. I don’t feel Brawlhalla needs a deeper roster of characters in its initial phase. I think attention being paid to creating new characters is a mistake while other parts of the game remain more shallow than the current roster of characters. Specifically I think attention needs to be paid to level variety. Each existing character should have their own level, simply in the sense that the theme of the level corresponds to the character. Currently in Brawlhalla there are I think double as many characters as levels and not a single level seems to match up to any characters.  In my opinion eight characters and eight unique levels is more enjoyable than twelve characters and four non-connected levels. Every  level should feel different top to bottom, everything from music, layout, and color scheme. Currently the levels in Brawlhalla feel generic and I would like to see them tailored so that each character has their own level. I would also like to the see the current levels and any additional levels have a more interactive element to them. I’m concerned that the creation of new characters seems to have priority over the creation of fun levels to fight within.  If the developers can create a character with a unique look and fighting style, there is no excuse for why they can’t do the same with the level design. 

- I’d like to see player sizes be scaled to be more representative of the characters. Some characters should be larger than other character, whereas, some characters should be smaller. Currently all the characters are the same size, and I think that’s a problem for both immersion and game balance. While talking about player size. I’d like to briefly touch on hit detection and hit priority. Most noticeably it seems hit detection is poor when dealing with UP-Aerial attacks and DOWN-Aerial attacks. The most obvious lack of hit-detetcion is when trying to hit an opponent who is above you in the air, when your character is below. Moving on, I think there is poorly working hit-priority in this game. Depending on a characters attributes shouldn’t say stronger characters attacks take priority over a weaker characters when they’re both attacking each other at the same time? This doesn’t seem to be the case from my limited time playing Brawlhalla. I think by changing the scale of characters that would allow for better hit detection and a more visible representation of the priority of attacks when people are fighting. There are things in Brawlhalla like character stats for attributes like speed/dexterity/strength and so on, this all seems silly as when you’re actually playing the game there don’t seem to be many differences between the characters. If you’re going to include stats the difference between characters needs to be significantly more pronounced, that includes both size and scale as well as hit detection and hit priority. 

A lot of fighting games live and die based on how viable they are for competitive players, that’s the harsh reality of this genre.  The fighting mechanics of Brawlhalla I think need to be fine tuned. There simply isn’t enough here to keep non-causal players around. Perhaps adding the ability for players to block or even grab each other would go a long way towards alleviating some of the shortfalls of the current combat system? 

- Items and their role in Brawlhalla. Brawlhalla seems to be somewhat balanced around the spear-like weapons and to a lesser extent the gun or sword weapons. I’ve found this to be fun and I think the weapons are well balanced and the attacks and animations are varied well enough. It’s of my opinion that items are appearing with too great a frequency. Due to weapons appearing too frequently their importance has been marginalized. There is no incentive to rush across the board and fight over a spear or any other weapon as within moments another weapon will appear and then another and so on. Most importantly, the frequency of item distribution leads to spears, guns, and swords, being primarily used as charged-up projectile attacks since you can always almost instantly pick up another spear, gun, or sword. Brawlhalla is fast-paced and with too many items on the screen the gameplay is frenzied. So it’s beneficial to keep distance between yourself and the other opponents. The most efficient way to do this is to throw weapons instead of using weapons to actually fight with. Since there is almost an endless supply of weapons and items there is no penalty for choosing to throw my weapon away instead of fighting with it. Considering the strength of the items and weapons, it seems odd to create a gameplay style that devalues them. 

There also needs to be more variety of items introduced into the game. Currently there are simply too few items available and coupled with the high frequency of appearance,  I can’t be the only person who is fatigued already of the items in this game. My suggestion would be to focus on introducing not more weapons, but, more unique items. The goal of items/weapons (outside the core spears, swords, and guns) should be to introduce randomness into the game at least to a reasonable extent. I would suggest thinking about adding some generic power-ups and trying to put a Brawlhalla spin on them.  Currently there simply are too few items in Brawlhalla and the items or weapons that are available appears with such a high frequency that they are creating likely a gameplay that isn’t as intended. 

- Customized game options. When setting up a match for both online or local play, the users should be able to customize every aspect of the ruleset. From number of lives, length of match time, what items appear and at what frequency. I would also like to see the inclusion of an optional handicap system as a way to balance the game for players who are of great skill differences.

- I think the scoreboard should be moved from the top right to the bottom center. The least used real estate on the screen is the bottom middle as that is typically the underside of a level. IThe top right, where the scoreboard currently is, is too action filled as there is lots of aerial combat in this game and jumping to the side. Also considering the pace of Brawlhalla it’s difficult to look away to the top right and check both health and scores. I think making the scoreboard larger and placing in the bottom center of the screen is more functional and visually pleasing. 

- Add Taunts/Cheers.  If you look at many successful fighting games of the past, taunts or cheers are iconic parts of those games. I would like to see a single animation and accompanying sound effect for each character to act as a taunt or a cheer. I would like this “move” to be used freely in game. I think other players of Brawlhalla and fans of this genre would find it to be a welcome addition.  

--------------------

Overall, Brawlhalla is a fun game, however, the current core fighting mechanics are simply too shallow. On the positive Brawlhalla is only in the Alpha Stage and hopefully by time it reaches the Beta Stage the game will have made improvements in the areas I’ve rambled on about above.",TRUE
2014-10-24 23:46,"This game is a really awesome game. It would be great and fun with friends.

Every character has a special status, moves(depending on the weapon), and weapons.

It's just like Super Smash Bros.",TRUE
2014-07-29 0:38,"I am very positive about this game and so happy to see a game following the footsteps of the very popular super smash bros. Controls are very easy to handle (I use a controller), the art is pretty nice, and there is pretty much no lag. I have high hopes for the future of this game and I hope that its reputation grows.",TRUE
2014-07-23 11:53,"A wonderful game that is extremely fun to play. The multi-player is a lot of fun even though it is still slightly laggy (much better than before).  And even not playing in multiplayer it is still an extremely fun game to play, which will obviously get even better as more and more things are added. If only there were more people that play!  I definitely recommend buying this game.  It's one of my favorite games and is completely worth the price (or more)!",TRUE

2014-07-11 8:14,"Looking for Super Smash Brothers on PC but can't find anything like it?
Want to have fun with your friends or Random people online? Or even just Bots?
Don't fancy standart Brawlers like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat?

Then buy this Game. It is super fun, me and my friends are having lot's of fun together.

BUT, have in Mind (at the time this review was written) this is only Alpha Version 0.3. So there isn't much stuff implemented yet. It is funny as it is and lots of new Content gets implemented in the future :)",TRUE

My only worries are in the future updates  it says something like ""free character rotation"" which I hope that doesn't mean change your characters in the middle of the game because that would sink it like lost saga and another concern is character advancement.  I really hope leveling wouldn't come into play in a casual game.  That I don't see the benefit of.  But good job.",TRUE

Brawlhalla is pretty much a smash bro's for the PC, except with a few twists.

Here's a Quick Look video I did so you expierence for yourself what this game is like. I've got a summary below for those of you who just like the short and dirty summary. I won't judge. (Please note that throwing weapons is nowhere near as effective now, resulting in longer brawls and less chaotic deaths)

http://youtu.be/-RJhu-8S4co

The basic concept of this game is to knock your opponents off the stage the most to win a match. There's no health bars to be seen, and only two basic attack buttons, light and heavy. The heavy attack being what you'll need to use if you wanna send your oppenents rocketing off the screen. Now while you can choose to fight with your bare fists, you can also use the few weapons that constantly get scattered throughout the match. Each weapon you pick up gives you a new moveset to fight with exception for some one-time-use ones like the battlehorn, mines, bombs, and spikeball. And that's pretty much all I can say about the mechanics of the game besides you can dodge, too.

However, as simple as it may be, it's still a blast to play over and over again, even better when you have friends over who you can banter with and taunt. It's just satisfying to send enemies bouncing off walls to their demise, even more so when you bounce your weapons/bombs off walls and hit them when they least expected it. I also like when you're waiting a short while for a match to begin, you get matched up with some bots so you're not waiting around and doing nothing.

But let's get some of the negatives out of the way.

Now I know this is early access, so I'm willing to excuse most of these things I'm about to list:
*If you plan to play online, be prepared for terrible lag and characters warping all around the screen. It also isn't fun when you see your weapon connect with an opponent, but it phases through them like a ghost. (Also the online scene is pretty much dead at this point. Not many people playing)
*Although there are 4(5 now) different characters currently, they don't play any differently. While it may be balanced, I'd like some variety. (This has been changed somewhat in the new patch. Characters have different stats and some unique moves depending on what you're using)
*There is currently only 1 stage and 1 mode you can play, which is a straight deathmatch. Now don't get me wrong, the mode and stage are solid, but at least one more map and maybe a team dealthmatch should've been thrown in as well. (There's a new 1v1 match currently, but if you're single player, you have to do a weird thing by turning off bots, which really leaves one left to fight and allows you to play it. You should just be allowed to click a bot to turn it off or have a stage select.)
*The game is super short currently and there isn't much to do/unlock. I've only played for an hour currently and have already seen everything this game has to offer. While this game has great replay value, I'm certain this might turn a few people away for the price this is currently listed at.
*Unfortunately, there is also a lack of unique weapons, too. There's a hammer, sword, lance, and a gun, not including the throwing weapons. While the reskinned weapons they have in there may look like they do something different, they don't, so this limits the amount of diversity and mayhem that can happen on screen.

But hey, even after all that, why do I still recommend this game? Because it's still fun. And if you're willing to overlook just the lack of content it suffers from currently, I'm sure it'll grow into something better. And if the price tag is the issue, this will become free to play in the future, so you can wait until then to get it. It'll probably have more content by then, too.

So to sum it up, this is a solid game that can grow into something much bigger. The local multiplayer is fantastic right now, and if you can stand the lag or maybe get lucky, you may find the online multiplayer fun as well. So if you can look past some the of negatives I listed, you're gonna find yourself having a great time with this game.

(I'll try to keep this review up to date, so when major updates start rolling out, please feel free to yell at me to give another look at this game.)",TRUE
2014-05-14 15:25,Amazing Definently a good buy. If I were you guys I would either get it when it comes out or NOW! They almost bring out updates every day plus it has endless gameplay fun! So what are you waiting for lets brawl.,TRUE
2014-05-09 13:47,"I would recommend anyone to this game if you're looking for a similar super smash bros for the PC. Maybe it doesn't have the best music and have a short amount of characters and have lag issues while you're playing online. But of course, this is only an early access game and their planning to fix all of that. This game has the potential to become one of the best games out there and I hope I wasted my money to support this game even further. The combat in this game is a real fast paced.",TRUE
2014-05-07 4:49,"This is amazing, fantastic, masterpiece


",TRUE
2014-05-03 2:46,"So here's my synopsis so far (Keep in mind I haven't played for long) The game has some pretty serious lag issues but they did state that that was going to happen. The characters are cool looking and I like that. But the problem that I see is that all the characters are the same other than looks, which sort of bothers me. I would recommend the game as the gameplay is a lot of fun and enjoyable.
EDIT: Alright so Now that I've played the game a litle more I want to elaborate more. The devs said they were making the characters unique and that's fantastic I'm super pumped for it, with the new patches there's not really balance issues. Today I got to play with my friend locally and I had SO much fun! I would highly recommend this game",TRUE

2014-05-01 21:14,"If you are looking for a Super Smash Brothers kind game, this is it! It is in Alpha, with only 4 characters, and limited moves...but the developers have been keeping in constant contact on the forums and they already have a ton of things planned. I enjoy this game a lot!",TRUE
2014-05-01 2:26,"Great game! Its like Super Smash bros but for the PC.

Although I do recommend this game its in EARLY EARLY alpha meaning the game is like 10 percent made and the lag is HORRIBLE. Reguardless its a great game with an amazing concept this game can either be the next E-sport or the next waste of 13 dollars.

But that did not stop me and my friends from having loads of fun. I'm going to say do not pick this game up now, but pick it up after it gets some fine tuning. I can't wait to see what direction this game goes and I have a feeling its going to be up with there with the best.",TRUE
